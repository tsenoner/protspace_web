/**
 * @vitest-environment jsdom
 *
 * Issue #453: `WebglRenderPerfRunner` reads the scatter-plot host through an
 * untyped `as any` bridge, so when a field it depends on moves off the host
 * nothing fails at build time — the runner just spins. `_zoom` / `_svgSelection`
 * moved into `PlotInteractionController` (both `private`), and the readiness gate
 * `_waitForHostFullyLoaded` waited out its full 10-minute timeout ever since,
 * while `_applyZoomScale` / `_applyZoomTranslate` degraded to silent no-ops.
 *
 * These tests lock the two OBSERVABLE consequences rather than any field name,
 * so they survive whichever shape the fix takes (host getters, a typed
 * `PerfHost` bridge like `_interactionHost()`, …):
 *   1. the gate resolves promptly against a real, loaded host;
 *   2. the runner's zoom helpers actually move the plot.
 *
 * They deliberately drive the runner instance the HOST owns (`_webglRenderPerf`)
 * rather than constructing one, so a change to the runner's constructor
 * arguments is exercised too.
 *
 * jsdom has no WebGL, but that does not block this: `WebGLRenderer`'s constructor
 * only wires a `ContextLossController` and defers GL acquisition, so
 * `_webglRenderer` is non-null here and the gate's other conditions are all
 * satisfiable. The renderer logs "WebGL2 not available" on render; that is
 * expected and irrelevant to the readiness contract.
