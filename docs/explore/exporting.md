# Exporting Results

ProtSpace allows you to export publication-ready figures, raw data, and protein IDs.

## Export Button

Click **Export** in the control bar to see available formats:

| Format          | Description                                               |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PNG**         | Raster image of the current view with legend              |
| **PDF**         | PDF document of the current view with legend              |
| **Protein IDs** | Text file with newline-separated identifiers              |
| **Parquet**     | `.parquetbundle` file with all data and optional settings |

## Image Export (PNG / PDF)

When PNG or PDF is selected, you have two export paths:

### Figure Editor (Recommended)

Click **Figure Editor** to open a full-screen editor with live preview. This is the primary workflow for creating publication-quality figures. See the [Figure Editor guide](./figure-editor) for full documentation.

Key features:

- **Journal presets** for Nature, Science, Cell, PNAS, PLOS, and presentations
- **Photoshop-style Dimensions panel** — Width/Height/DPI, unit toggle (px/mm/in/cm), Resample on/off, aspect-lock chain
- **Overlays** — circles, arrows, and text labels to annotate your figure
- **Zoom insets** — true geometric magnification with a per-inset Dot size slider
- **Legend customization** — position, font size in pt or px, columns, free-floating placement
- **Click-to-select + Delete/Backspace** — click an overlay or inset (canvas or sidebar) and press Delete to remove it
- **Persistent settings** — your layout is saved to localStorage and optionally embedded in `.parquetbundle` files
- **Print-correct output** — PNG includes pHYs DPI metadata; PDF page size is mm-accurate

### Quick Export

Click **Quick Export** to download an image immediately using default or previously saved settings. No preview — useful when you've already configured the Figure Editor and want the same output again.

## Parquet Export

Export a `.parquetbundle` file that can be loaded back into ProtSpace or shared.

- **Include legend settings**: Saves your current legend customizations (colors, shapes, ordering, visibility, palette) inside the file. Anyone who loads it will see the same visual configuration.
- **Figure editor settings**: When legend settings are included, the Figure Editor state (dimensions, DPI, legend layout, overlays, insets) is also saved. This lets you reopen the Figure Editor exactly where you left off.

## Protein IDs Export

Exports a plain text file with one protein ID per line. Useful for downstream analysis.

## What Gets Exported

| State             | Exported Data          |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Proteins isolated | Only isolated proteins |
| No isolation      | All proteins           |

Use isolation to export specific subsets.
